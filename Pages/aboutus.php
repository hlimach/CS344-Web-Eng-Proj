                <p class="aboutus-title" style="font-size:23px" >It's Track TV time ... Friends' is on. <br> <br> It's that shared love of watching TV. Never missing an episode. Reacting to moments with tears, laughter and intrigue. Sitting with others, turning to them and saying at exactly the same time - 'Wait, what? Chandler and Rachel?' <br><br>

Then the world changed. Peoples watching habits became fragmented, different. The TV universe got bigger ... and yet felt smaller at the same time. Mobile phones, tablets and other devices allowed us to watch from anywhere. Entire series were released in a day. 10 channels became 1,000. TV just kept getting better, and bigger, and better. And more than ever, we wanted to stay on top of our favorite shows. We got enraged when anyone even hinted at a spoiler. And finding our tribes, those like us, to share moments and react to, at the moment we felt it, became so vital, so enriching, so core to our daily routines.<br><br>

And so we created our own multi-platform, virtual TV tracking community of millions so that we'd never lose, only grow, that emotional pull we shared and loved when we first heard those words - It's Track TV Time ... 'Friends' is on.</p>
